    <h2 class="header">History</h2>

    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="event">

        <p>Strava, which means "strive" in Swedish (although spelled "sträva" in Swedish with an "ä"), was founded in 2009. Cofounders Michael Horvath and Mark Gainey first met in the 1980s as members of Harvard University's rowing crew.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="event">

        <p>Initially popular with cyclists and eventually runners, by 2017 over 1 billion activities had been uploaded to the service. By 2020, Strava had more than 50 million users and three billion activities had been uploaded. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="event">
   
        <p>In May 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Strava made significant changes to its user terms. Some of the features that were previously free were only to be available with a paid-for subscription, and most new developments going forward would be available only to subscribers.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="event">
    
        <p>In March 2022, Strava stopped operating in Russia and Belarus because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="event">
    
        <p>In early 2023, Strava significantly raised subscription prices in many markets—some more than doubling. A month earlier, the company laid off approximately 14% of its workforce. The company's last venture capital funding was a $110 million Series F in 2020.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="event">
      
        <p>In January 2023 Strava also acquired Fatmap, a company focused on building high-resolution 3D maps used for outdoor activities, with a long-term goal to integrate Fatmap’s core platform into the Strava platform.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="event">
      
        <p>In February 2023, founder and current CEO Michael Horvath announced that he would resign. In December 2023, Strava announced Michael Martin, former executive at YouTube, as the new CEO.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="event">
      
        <p>On March 5, 2025, Strava moved into a new headquarters office on four levels of the 181 Fremont tower in San Francisco. In May 2025, Strava acquired the running app Runna and the cycling app Breakaway, increasing its valuation to around $2.2 billion, including its debt.</p>
